# Sea battle over a local network in Python. 


I implemented the popular game "Sea Battle" in Python.
In this game, I added the ability to play two players while on a local network.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/qxtony/battleship.git
```

Go to the folder and install the dependencies:

```bash
cd battleship
poetry install
```

To start the program, enter the following:
```sh
python -m battleship
```
